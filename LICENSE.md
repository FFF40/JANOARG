# License/Derivative guidelines

You may create derivatives (charts) using the tools provided inside the project as you wish
but please follow these guidelines before doing so:

- Don't extract and redistribute official charts of the game. We do allow derivative charts
of the original songs appeared in the game but please put clearly visible spoiler warnings
before the charts are played if you record them into a video or on the title and thumbnail
if you release them to social medias.

- Please do not remake the project into your game and republish it without permission from
the game's author (ducdat0507). If anything we would recommend you to come up with your own
original rhythm game ideas instead, after all that's how rhythm games keep their interest!
