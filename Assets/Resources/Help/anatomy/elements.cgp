Chartmaker UI Elements
$
As with most other programs, the JANOARG Chartmaker communicates with the user (charter) using what's 
called an user interface (or UI, for short) which lets the charter make charts quicker and easier.
$
The Chartmaker's UI consist of two parts: the Home screen and the Editor screen. The Home screen appears 
when you start the Chartmaker program, while the Editor screen appears in place of the Home screen after 
you open a Playable Song to edit.
