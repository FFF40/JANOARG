(.[wait 0.5s].[wait 0.5s].[wait 1s]You've been lying here for a while now.)

(Come to think of it, it's already been a while since that event happened.)

(.[wait 0.5s].[wait 0.5s].[wait 1s]You should probably get yourself up now.)

(.[wait 0.5s].[wait 0.5s].[wait 0.5s])

(.[wait 0.5s].[wait 0.5s].[wait 1s]Okay, you think it's time to introduce you to yourself.)

(Your name is \[NAME PENDING\], and you've been living here for 3 years since that event that bound multiple worlds

(...Oh yeah, these things.)

(As a result of the worlds merging, these instabilities keep popping up randomly.)

(If you touch them, you'll get sucked into the instability and will have to tune them.)

(Despite that, they aren't really lethal and will disappear when you ignore them.)

(And when it's done properly, these things gives you power that allows you to change the world at will, albeit limited.)

(You've grown to accept them although they can get quite troublesome sometimes, and you quite like the tuning process.)

(...You think it's good to refresh yourself on how the tuning works.)
