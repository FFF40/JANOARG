# Chartmaker

The <b>Chartmaker</b> is a tool used to create and edit charts used for the rhythm game aspect of
JANOARG. Since the game is mainly revolved around that rhythm game aspect, this is the most
important tool inside the editor so far. Due to the flexible nature of the game, the Chartmaker
will have a learning curve of its own, therefore it is recommended that you should read all of this
section of the manual. However, to quick-start the process, an interactive tutorial is included to
let you know the basics.
