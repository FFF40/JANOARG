# Chartmaker - Picker

The <b>Picker</b> lets you select actions or items to be placed on the Timeline. Items on the
Picker may vary based on the current tab selected on the Timeline but these three actions will
always be available on all tabs:

- <b>Cursor</b>: Click on an item to select it on the Inspector, and drag the background to seek.
If you drag the item view part of the background, the seek will snap into the ruler, otherwise, if
you drag the ruler part of the background, the seek will not snap.

- <b>Select</b>: Same as Cursor, but dragging the background will multi-select items instead. Note
that you can also right-drag to multi-select items in Cursor mode.

- <b>Delete</b>: Click on an item to delete it. The editor will ask you to confirm by showing a
question mark (?) on the item you want to delete before proceeding.
