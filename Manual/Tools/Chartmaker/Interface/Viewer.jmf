# Chartmaker - Viewer

The <b>Viewer</b> lets you preview what would happen when the song is played in the game. You can
also edit some items directly on this view when it is selected on the Inspector.

- <b>Edit Items</b>: If an object is visible on the screen (like a Lane or a Hit Object), you can
drag the round (Center) knob to move it, or the square <Start> and triangular |End> knob to move
one of its ends. You can also hold Shift to make them snap into the background grid.
