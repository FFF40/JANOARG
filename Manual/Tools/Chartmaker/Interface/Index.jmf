# Chartmaker Interface

The Chartmaker consists of two screens:

## Start screen

The Start screen is shown when no Playable Song has been selected. This screen consists of only one
window:

=> Tools/Chartmaker/Interface/Start.jmf Start

## Edit screen

The Edit screen is shown when a Playable Song has been selected and will be the screen that you use
the most. This screen is a bit more involved, here is a mock up of the components that make up the
screen:
