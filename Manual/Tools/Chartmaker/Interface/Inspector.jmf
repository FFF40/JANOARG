# Chartmaker - Inspector

The <b>Inspector</b> shows details of the item you've selected. There are two modes of the
Inspector:

- <b>Properties</b>: Show the properties of the selected items. For items that have a time
position, the time is displayed on the title bar or the panel.

- <b>Storyboard</b>: If the item supports storyboarding, shows a list of Timestamps on that
item. It is recommended to select Storyboard items using the Timeline instead.
