# Playable Song - Lane Step

A <b>Lane Step</b> defines the Lane's properties such as its position at a point of time. Together
they define the shape of the Lane.

## Properties

- <b>Offset</b> <i>(Float)</i>: The time position of the lane step, in song beats.

- <b>Start/End Position</b> <i>(Storyboardable, Vector2)</i>: The space position of the lane step,
defined by two points in space.

- <b>Start/End Position Easing</b> <i>(Easing)</i>: Four easing for each axis of each position of
the lane step.

- <b>Scroll Speed</b> <i>(Storyboardable, Float)</i>: The scroll speed multiplier applied to the
global scroll speed set by the player. This defines the Z position of the lane step.
