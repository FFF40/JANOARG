# Playable Song - Chart

The <b>Chart</b> is the playable part of the rhythm game. Each Chart of a song represents a
difficulty of that song.

## Properties

- <b>Target</b> <i>(String)</i>: The chart's relative path compared to the Playable Song file.

- <b>Difficulty Index</b> <i>(Integer)</i>: The structural position of the chart in the game.
Conventionally this would be a number from 0-3 for normal charts, with 0 being the easiest chart
and increasing the difficulty up to 3 being the hardest chart. There may be special charts, which
starts at -1 and decreasing in index for each subsequent chart.

- <b>Difficulty Name</b> <i>(String)</i>: The name of the chart. The normal naming scheme for
charts is: 0=Simple, 1=Normal, 2=Complex, 3=Overdrive. Special charts may have their own difficulty
names.

- <b>Difficulty Constant</b> <i>(Float)</i>: The difficulty number rating of the chart, used in
internal calculations. A higher difficulty constant means a harder chart that requires more skill
to play. Sometimes a difficulty constant of 0 is used for charts that are non-serious / unfair to
play / very gimmicky and should not be included in anything that involves player progression.

- <b>Difficulty Level</b> <i>(String)</i>: The visible difficulty number rating of the chart, 
visible to the player. Normally this would just be the difficulty constant, with an asterisk (*)
placed after the number for charts that are designed to be played using 3 or more fingers. For some
special occasions however, this field will be obstructed to give players a sense of mystery (e.g.
Overdrive É‘ or April Fool's ??)

## Sub-objects

- <b>Pallete</b> <i>(Pallete)</i>: The chart's pallete.

- <b>Camera</b> <i>(Camera Controller)</i>: The chart's camera controller.

- <b>Lane Groups</b> <i>(List of Lane Groups)</i>: A list of lane groups that appears inside the chart.

- <b>Lanes</b> <i>(List of Lanes)</i>: A list of lanes that appears inside the chart.
