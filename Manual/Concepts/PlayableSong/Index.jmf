# Playable Song

Each song in the game is represented in a Playable Song file. The Playable Song file contains
details about the song such as the song's name/artist and also paths to each Chart file. Each Chart
file corresponds to a difficulty of that song and contains all information about that difficulty
like the name, its rating number, and objects that will be appear inside when the song is played
with that difficulty selected.

Here is a flow chart summarizing JANOARG's Playable Song structure:
