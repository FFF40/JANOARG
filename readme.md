## How to Make Charts
* Download the Standalone Chartmaker [(in releases)](https://github.com/ducdat0507/JANOARG/releases)
* Unpack .zip and run Chartmaker.exe
* Have fun!

Note: The Standalone Chartmaker has less features than the Unity Editor-based Chartmaker and is in the pre-release stage, however the standalone version does not require Unity Editor to run. If you can run Unity and open this project I recommend using the Unity Editor version for the time being.

## How to Contribute Code

### You'll need the following:
* A personal computer (Windows/Mac/Linux, the editor isn't available on mobile, sorry)
* A copy of Unity Editor (preferably version 2022.2.2)
* A code editor (any text editor should work)
* A copy of Git/Github Desktop is recommended so you can update/submit code easily

### Instructions
* Clone the project (by downloading it to your computer or by running the following command in the cmd/terminal: `git clone https://github.com/ducdat0507/JANOARG.git`).
* Open the root folder using the Unity Editor.
* Make edits to the code (of course)
* Send the project (by making a pull request)
