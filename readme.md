## Contributing

### Requirement:
* Unity Editor 2022.3

And any editor of your liking, including notepad. We recommend [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as well any other IDE that supports full Unity and C# integration.

### Additional (No programming skills required)
As of now, we had plenty of song entry, but we are lacking of charters. We would like your help to fill the gaps! You can get started by installing the chartmaker which is available for all (desktop) platforms, and joining the Discord server.
